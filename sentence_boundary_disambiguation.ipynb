A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination . Individual random events are, by definition, unpredictable, but if the probability distribution is known, the frequency of different outcomes over repeated events (or \"trials\") is predictable. For example, when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will tend to occur twice as often as 4. In this view, randomness is not haphazardness ; it is a measure of uncertainty of an outcome. Randomness applies to concepts of chance, probability, and information entropy .'\n",
